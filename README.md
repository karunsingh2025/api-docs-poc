POC for using GitHub Web Pages for API documentation

The following text is to test GitHub's search capability that can be leveraged to search for the appropriate APIs and related API documentation (published to GitHub Web Pages).
The next step would be to add similar text to the API definition files so it gets propagated to the API documentation that is generated/updated and published to GitHub Web Pages for the repo and then text if GitHubs search can find it.

So here goes...
Let's make a polling API to vote for the following skiing related topics:
- Best male skier on the planet (e.g., Marco Odermatt)
- Best male skier of all time (e.g. Bodie Miller, Hans Krammer)
- Largest Alpine skiing resort in the World (e.g., Les 3 Vallées (The Three Valleys) in France)
