POC for using GitHub Web Pages for API documentation

The following text is to test GitHub's search capability that can be leveraged to search for the appropriate APIs and related API documentation (published to GitHub Web Pages).
The next step would be to add similar text to the API definition files so it gets propagated to the API documentation that is generated/updated and published to GitHub Web Pages for the repo and then text if GitHubs search can find it.

Here are some search enable keywords to test GitHub's search capabilities:
A polling API to vote for the following skiing related topics:
- Best female skier on the planet (e.g., Mikaela Shiffrin, Lindsey Vonn, Janica Kostelić)
- Most popular Alpine skiing resort by continent (e.g., Chamonix, Courchevel, Zermatt, SaasFee)
